v0.8,2
====================
* changed line height for selected items to help differentiate them from non-selected items

v0.8.1
====================
* Updated License

v0.8.0
====================
* Removed the default reference to the item chevron, since the Predix asset team does not support that. the functionality is still there, but now, you have to pass an attribute (has-children) and set it to true to ensure the chevrons show up.
